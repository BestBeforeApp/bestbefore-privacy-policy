Summary  
• We only collect data necessary to provide the app’s features.  
• All cloud-stored data (photos, expiration dates, etc.) is stored securely via Firebase.  
• We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data for advertising or marketing purposes.  
• We comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Legal Framework  
BestBefore is governed by the laws and regulations of Austria and is fully committed to GDPR compliance. This includes, but is not limited to:  
• Transparency: Clear communication about what data is collected and how it is used.  
• Data Minimization: Limiting data collection to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.  
• Security: Implementing appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.  
• User Rights: Respecting and facilitating the rights of individuals to access, correct, delete, or restrict their personal data.

Data Collection

Camera Access  
To allow users to document food items with photos and through barcode scanning, BestBefore requests access to the device camera. Photos are stored on the device and if the user is subscribed securely via Firebase.

Account Creation  
You can use BestBefore without creating an account. However, if you wish to use online functionality such as cross-device syncing or cloud storage, you must subscribe and create an account. This includes providing an email address and password, which are securely stored via Firebase Authentication. Your email address is only used to:  
• Log into your account  
• Enable data sync across devices  
• Send password reset instructions  
• Store it securely on your device. This happens only if you had a subscription active at the same time of being logged in with your email address. This happens in order to show you a dialog with which you can either upload your user created data(e.g.: food items, shopping lists) to Firebase (in order to share it with others or just have it stored in an additional place) or remove it from your device.  
We do not use your email for advertising or marketing.

Account Activity  
Depending on the device used, this data may include information such as your IP address, device and application identification numbers, browser type, push notifications token, hardware model, operating system, and system configuration information.

IP logging  
By default, we do not maintain permanent IP logs associated with your Account. However, temporary IP logs might be kept in the future because of future improvements to BestBefore and its services in order to prevent abuse and fraud and to provide you options for multiple device management. If you engage in activities that violate our terms and conditions, such as spamming, DDoS attacks, or brute force attacks, your IP address may be permanently retained. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in protecting our service from malicious activities and to provide you with device management features.

Crash Reporting  
We use Firebase Crashlytics to monitor and fix app issues. Crash logs contain technical data like app version and device type, but no personal identifiers. These logs are used only to improve app performance and stability.

Information regarding Minors  
Our Services are not intended for children below the age of 13 and do not target this age group.

Mobile Device Access  
The BestBefore app may request access or permission to certain features from your mobile device, e.g. your mobile device’s camera. Access to some of these sources is required for certain app features (e.g. you need to enable the camera permission in order to use the app’s main features). Your device is required to have a camera to use the BestBefore app. If you wish to change BestBefore app access or permissions, you may do so in your device’s settings.

Third-Party Data  
The only third-party data BestBefore collects is payment-related information in order to provide you with optional premium Services (see more at the Payment Information section).

Payment Information  
We may collect data necessary to process your payment in the form of payment confirmations, identifiers, subscription activation and deactivation dates, payment amount, subscription plan associated with your payment, payment time, payment type, payment method, whether a discount or voucher was applied, upcoming and previous payment dates. We use this information to provide you with the selected Subscription plan. All your personal payment data (e.g. credit cards) is handled and stored by Google. We do not collect, process or store your payment information such as credit card numbers.

Ad Data  
We use Google AdMob to display in-app advertisements. AdMob may collect anonymous usage data to personalize ads. See Google’s AdMob Privacy Policy for more information.

Communicating with the Company  
Messages you send to us, such as support inquiries, bug reports, or feature suggestions, may be stored by our team to help us improve Services, build Services documentation, and frequently asked questions (FAQs) if deemed useful.

Links to External Websites  
The app may include links to websites and products of interest. However, we do not take responsibility for the content found on those linked websites. Please note that external websites operate under their own terms and conditions and privacy policies.

Embedded Content  
We may use third parties to provide embedded content, such as pictures and videos. Embedded content may collect information about you. The legal basis for this is to provide rich and educational content in order for us to drive interest and growth.

Cookie & Tracking Technologies Policy  
We do not use traditional web cookies in the BestBefore mobile app. However, some of the third-party services we use — such as Firebase and Google AdMob — may utilize mobile identifiers or similar technologies that serve a comparable purpose to cookies.

These technologies may collect information such as:  
• Device type and operating system  
• App usage data  
• Advertising identifiers

These identifiers help us:  
• Provide app functionality and analytics  
• Improve app performance and stability  
• Deliver personalized or non-personalized in-app ads (with your consent, where required)

Personalized ads are only shown if you have given consent via our in-app consent mechanism (CMP).

Data Usage  
We use the information that you provide to:  
• Provide our Services under our Terms and Conditions.  
• Facilitate account creation and authentication and otherwise manage user accounts.  
• Respond to user inquiries/offer support to users.  
• Control access permissions to your data and your account.  
• Deliver and facilitate the delivery of services to the user.  
• Send administrative information to you (details about our products and services, changes to our terms and policies, and other similar information).  
• Fulfill and manage your Subscription Plans.  
• Protect our Services from fraud, abuse and spam.  
• Maintain and improve our systems and Services.  
• Anonymously analyze collected data and information statistically (this helps us ensure an optimal level of protection for the personal data we process).

Data Storage  
All cloud-stored data is encrypted and stored via Firebase’s infrastructure.  
We store personal data only as long as needed to fulfill its purpose or as required by European or other relevant laws. If the purpose no longer applies or the legal storage period ends, we routinely block or delete the data according to legal requirements (i.e., account inactivity).

Service Providers and Data Subprocessors

• Google:  
Purpose: Play Store, Android payments, In-app purchases and subscription management, Android app infrastructure

Data Retention  
Active users: We keep your data while you are subscribed and using our Service, subject to rights set in our Terms.  

Account termination: You can request your data to be irrevocably deleted (Right to be forgotten). You may do so at any time directly in the BestBefore app, which also is the only way to prove you are the owner of your account. Upon account deletion request, all user data we have on record is promptly removed. Deleting an account removes all permanent traces of data.  

Other cases: If your account is suspended or terminated, we might keep your account information if we think it’s needed to prove a breach of our Terms or if there’s ongoing or expected action from law enforcement or other parties.

Data Disclosure  
We do not sell, trade, rent, or transfer your personal information to others without prior notice. However, there may be instances where BestBefore shares your personal information with others to facilitate the delivery of our Services, such as:

Disclosure provided by law or for protection: We will only share the minimal user data we have if required by an enforceable court order or we believe it is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of BestBefore, our employees, our customers, or others. Whenever legally allowed, we will notify the user prior to any data disclosure, provided we have a means to contact them (i.e., email address).

Disclosure in the event of merger or sale: We may disclose personal information if there is a merger, sale of the business, or similar event.

Your Privacy Rights at BestBefore  
If you believe your rights have been violated, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority.  
You have control over your personal data processed by BestBefore when using our services. You can access, edit and delete your data through your Account in the BestBefore app.  
If your Account has been suspended due to a breach of our terms and conditions and you wish to exercise your data rights, please contact our support team.

Amendment of this Privacy Policy  
Subject to applicable law, BestBefore reserves the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time to comply with changed legal requirements or to implement new functionalities in the Privacy Policy. You are responsible for reviewing the Terms regularly while using your Account or the Services. Continued use of your Account or Services, or not deleting your Account after changes, signifies your acceptance of the updated Terms. The latest Terms will apply to all future use and any disputes arising thereafter. The current Privacy Policy is always in the BestBefore app.
